CIS3515: Mobile Application Development
Lab Section 3


This is the finished BookShelf app from CIS3515.

BookShelf:

This is a bookshelf app that displays a list of books from a web API using JSONObjects and a JSONArray, and when one book is clicked,
it displays the books title, author, and an image of the book cover (all taken from the JSONObject.)

In this lab, I have correctly integrated the AudioBookService, have the book continue to play when the activity is restarted, 
perform a Toast when a book is played, 
and have integrated play, stop, and pause. I have the SeekBarProgress being associated with the book duration,
however it does not update as the book plays to show the current progress.
However, it will change the book's progress when the slider is moved by the user.
